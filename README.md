# Earthquakes Mapper & Date Picker :world_map: :date:
"Earthquakes Mapper &amp; Date-Time Picker" was created using PHP, JavaScript and JQuery with Bootstrap 4. Users can view earthquakes from around the world on Google Maps and filter based on a selectable date range. The earthquake data comes from USGS but there is an options section. It can be used to modify the Google Maps API key and map data source.
